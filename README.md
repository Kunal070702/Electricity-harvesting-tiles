# Electricity-harvesting-tiles
The Electricity Harvesting Tiles project focuses on developing a system of floor tiles capable of capturing mechanical energy from human footsteps and converting it into electrical power. This project explores sustainable energy generation using piezoelectric materials embedded in tiles, which generate power as pressure is applied.
